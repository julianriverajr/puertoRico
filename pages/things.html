                    El Yunque National Forest is a tropical rainforest in northeastern Puerto Rico. From El Portal
                    Visitor Center, a walkway winds through the surrounding treetops.

                    Trails run to La Mina waterfall and Mount Britton, then up to the high-altitude dwarf forest. In the
                    south are ancient petroglyphs,
                    made by the area's indigenous Taíno people. The forest comes alive with the nightly calls of coquí
                    tree frogs.

                    El Batey is a dive bar favored by a friend of Jisselle, whom has previously journeyed to San Juan
                    and rather enjoyed her time there. She highly recommends this specific dive bar, and more

                    During the day, Bioluminescent Mosquito Bay is your stereotypical Caribbean hideout, but at night,
                    the waters emit a blue glow from the organisms, called dinoflagellates, that live there. More than
                    600,000 bioluminescent dinoflagellates live in each gallon of bay water, and recent travelers have
                    been amazed by just how much visibility these tiny creatures provide.

                    Construction for this hulking six-story fortress started in 1539. It was originally built to deter
                    sea attacks, and went on to withstand two world wars and several other scrimmages. Now, El Castillo
                    San Felipe del Morro is Puerto Rico's go-to tourist attraction, both
                    for its extensive history and its outstanding vistas of the Atlantic Ocean.
