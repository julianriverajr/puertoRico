                    Condado Beach (Playa del Condado) is a beach named <i>Condado.</i> It
                    is a large public-access beach located in El Condado, a district of Santurce
                    in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is considered a dangerous beach with strong undercurrents.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Condado Beach is bordered by renown casinos and hotels. The area also has numerous
                    restaurants of different varieties, gift shops, and smaller inns. The part of the beach found
                    at the end of Vendig Street is considered a popular gay neighborhood of El Condado.

                    Isla Verde's golden-sand shores are framed with tall palm trees, hotels, restaurants, and shops.

                    <br />
                    It is divided into three main beaches: Pine Grove, where locals go surfing; Alambique, a more
                    relaxed strip of sand; and the Balneario de Carolina, a more relaxed location with lifeguards and
                    parking space.

                    At Posita beach (La Posita de P¡ñones), a long breakwater hinders the intense Atlantic waves from
                    crashing into "La Posita," which translates as the pool, or the puddle.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Its waters are similar to
                    those of a pool: calm and cool, perfect for bathing without having to struggle with the waves'
                    intensity. Moreover, you can park in front of the beach, and, across the PR-187, you can grab a bite
                    in some of Piñones' best beach shacks, like El Guariquitén.
